<div>Caliper tests are widely used to test for the presence of p-hacking and publi- cation bias based on the distribution of the z-statistics across studies. We show that without additional restrictions on the distribution of true effects, Caliper tests may suffer from substantial size distortions. We propose a modification of the existing Caliper test, referred to as the Robust Caliper test, which is shown to control size irrespective of the true effect distribution. We also propose a way of correcting the regression-based version of the Caliper test that allows for the inclusion of additional covariates. The proposed tests are easy to implement and perform well in practice.</div>
